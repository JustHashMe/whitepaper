# Introduction
## If you are a hotel...
Try to imagine the **full control on room rate**, the full price adjustment no matter the intermediaries commissions, capacity to create your own website of sales, the hotel position based on real experiences and not depending on negotiations for demanding contracts with integration or reservation platforms and free!

If you want to be the first to innovate, if you want to take the control of your services without depending on demanding negotiations with integration platforms, pricing control, time to market, etc., if you want to get a real reviews about the experiences of your guests, or simply you are exclusive and luxurious, this is your project!

## If you are a end user...
Tired of paying more for hotels that later are not good or services that you think are worth less, the result of conventional companies that want to profit at the expense of your experience or new blockchain companies promising something for nothing, just offering a token outside our platform, don't you believe them. 
A company wants money, that's why **we are here**, to create a new hotel sales model, a new model for buying hotel reservations, made to your specifications, with your participation.

So, what is the reason to have five different room rates for the same hotel, if at the end you are going to enjoy in the same way? This is not supply and demand, it is a succulent business that does nothing but hide the most important thing that is the hotel experience, with real added value and not by commissions resulting from negotiations and monopolies of the biggest players in this sector.

We want you to have more than one price per room, yes! But we want this due to one room offers massage and the other room does not, for example!

If you want to purchase a hotel service and pay for a real service, without hidden fees, without wasting time saving money, besides having a voice and vote, this is your project.

**This is your project, your foundation, your community**.

## If you are an intermediary (B2B)...
Integration platforms, bed banks, travel agencies, etc., they are ending their days if they do not adapt and change their philosophy. So join to us to make great things, you will became in a service provider with master nodes!

The hotel distribution models based on volume and/or commissions on the same product, are old fashion. Now the world tends increasingly to transparency and fair distribution of goods and services.

But even so, there are ways to maximize profits from this new hotel model and we will be happy to work with you. So if you want to get into this revolution, this is your project.

So remember, we are an innovative platform nothing to do with ICO, TOKEN or anything about that.

# Hotels
**This section explains how the hotels going to benefit from this innovative business model.**

## What's in it for the Hotels?
In one word: Blockchain. Thats means lower prices, no contracting processes, no billing periods = **more conversion rates (ROI) and more money to spend in a real hotel services**.

Thanks to Blockchain technology we can provide a business model with no added fees (only the transaction itself) and with a real potential for increasing visibility based on real experiences, as well as an immediate update of search results, increasing profits and striving to improve your service and not in negotiating demanding contracts with integrations.

In addition, the feared overbooking and delayed billing synchronizations with intermediaries disappear, as the hotel receives the money instantly, the litigation with the platforms are running out.

# Hotelcoin - HBF
Hotelcoin (HBF), is the cryptocurrency that we have defined to move transactions in our new network. Therefore the equivalent of ETH in this network will be HBF.

So we want to keep it an easy concept:
+ We arenâ€™t a TOKEN, we are a PLATFORM, like Ethereum!
+ You need a new address for the HBF, your Ethereum address here is not exists.

We are providing a smart platform and standards for the booking hotels in the Blockchain, but we don't want to forget the fast payments and the cotization value for the booking hotels. The idea is quite simple.

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/hbf-flow.png">
	<br>
	<b>Hotelcoin flow</b> - Miners wins, expends, buys or sells HBF, Users expends, buys or sells HBF, Hotels expends, buys or sells HBF.
</p>
<br>

Today exists a lot of tokens thanks to Ethereum platform and many companies are betting to create tokens to solve problems or changing some business models, but this focus will go to be in a big problem, we can't delegate all the business in a one network, for that our platform is a fork of Ethereum network. We are working to become in the unique entity for the hotels in the blockchain for help them.

## Max. supply
No initial max. supply, We are crazy? nope, we follow the **Ethereum** practices to our coin, because the main value of our project is our smart platform and our tools not just our coin. But don't worry, we are open to introduce the **PoS** consensus algorithm, this one could help us to limit the supply a lot. So, mine Hotelcoins or buy while you can.

### Will this cycle of supply and demand be enough?
Without your participation there is no revolution, but to guarantee the continuous flow, it is imperative that the hotel provide rewards to its users. This reward can be in the form of promotions, exchange of written user experiences or hotel recommendations to other potential users.

This point is one of the premises of the **DHI** when loading a hotel product or when obtaining the profit of the booked room.

# Miners
## Why to mine this coin?
Because without your support this community doesn't have sense, don't worry about the future **PoS** implementation this isn't planned yet, anyway you can mine now to hold in the future.
Another thing to mine our coin is that with this coin you could booking hotels and hotel services like a massages :)

## Guarantee

## Pools
We are in many pools, that you can find here [Mining pools](https://explorer.hotelbyte.org/pools). 
If you have a pool and you want to add our mineable cryptocurrency you need to keep just this words:

+ **Hotelcoin** as name of our coin
+ **HBF** as acronym of our coin
+ **Hotelbyte** as platform that you are contributing with your pool
+ **Ethash or Dagger** Algorithm, like **Ethereum**
+ **13s** Block time
+ **9 HBF** as reward per block
+ [Link to our explorer to find miners or blocks](https://explorer.hotelbyte.org)

## PoW
We are in **PoW** mode with 9 HBF rewards per block, with 13 seconds as average resolution time per block. We are planning to create a good way to introduce the **PoS** consensus algorithm, but this isn't planned yet, before that we need to expanse our network a lot.

## PoS
Proof Of Stake, read this one to get more information about this consensus algorithm: [PoS documents](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ)
So you know what is the **PoS** consensus algorithm, ok... 

### When to come here?
This consensus algorithm isn't planned yet, stay tuned and keep in mind to hold more **Hotelcoins** for your future rewards.

# Master Nodes
The master node is a trusted node to guarantee the Hotelbyte network for your hotel bookings. As a miner, or as an intermediary you could run a master node to get rewards for your node keeping a robust network.
The technical details going to be available in the Q3/2018, please see our roadmap for more information about the release date.

## Why is good a master node?
The intermediaries will become in a master nodes. Do you imagine thousend of master nodes guaranteeing **the Hotelbyte network** for your bookings?, sounds great, for that we need to convert the intermediaries in a master node service provider, it's the begin of the revolution inside of the B2B services.
