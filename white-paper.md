# Introduction
## If you are a hotel...
Try to imagine the **full control on room rate**, the full price adjustment no matter the intermediaries commissions, capacity to create your own website of sales, the hotel position based on real experiences and not depending on negotiations for demanding contracts with integration or reservation platforms and free!

If you want to be the first to innovate, if you want to take the control of your services without depending on demanding negotiations with integration platforms, pricing control, time to market, etc., if you want to get a real reviews about the experiences of your guests, or simply you are exclusive and luxurious, this is your project!

## If you are a end user...
Tired of paying more for hotels that later are not good or services that you think are worth less, the result of conventional companies that want to profit at the expense of your experience or new blockchain companies promising something for nothing, just offering a token outside our platform, don't you believe them. 
A company wants money, that's why **we are here**, to create a new hotel sales model, a new model for buying hotel reservations, made to your specifications, with your participation.

So, what is the reason to have five different room rates for the same hotel, if at the end you are going to enjoy in the same way? This is not supply and demand, it is a succulent business that does nothing but hide the most important thing that is the hotel experience, with real added value and not by commissions resulting from negotiations and monopolies of the biggest players in this sector.

We want you to have more than one price per room, yes! But we want this due to one room offers massage and the other room does not, for example!

If you want to purchase a hotel service and pay for a real service, without hidden fees, without wasting time saving money, besides having a voice and vote, this is your project.

**This is your project, your foundation, your community**.
